Forward one or more local ports to a pod.

Use resource `type`/`name` such as `deployment`/`mydeployment` to select a pod. Resource `type` defaults to `pod` if omitted.

If there are multiple pods matching the criteria, a pod will be selected automatically. The forwarding session ends when the selected pod terminates, and a rerun of the command is needed to resume forwarding.

{{ header }} Syntax

```shell
werf kubectl port-forward TYPE/NAME [options] [LOCAL_PORT:]REMOTE_PORT [...[LOCAL_PORT_N:]REMOTE_PORT_N]
```

{{ header }} Examples

```shell
  # Listen on ports 5000 and 6000 locally, forwarding data to/from ports 5000 and 6000 in the pod
  kubectl port-forward pod/mypod 5000 6000
  
  # Listen on ports 5000 and 6000 locally, forwarding data to/from ports 5000 and 6000 in a pod selected by the deployment
  kubectl port-forward deployment/mydeployment 5000 6000
  
  # Listen on port 8443 locally, forwarding to the targetPort of the service's port named "https" in a pod selected by the service
  kubectl port-forward service/myservice 8443:https
  
  # Listen on port 8888 locally, forwarding to 5000 in the pod
  kubectl port-forward pod/mypod 8888:5000
  
  # Listen on port 8888 on all addresses, forwarding to 5000 in the pod
  kubectl port-forward --address 0.0.0.0 pod/mypod 8888:5000
  
  # Listen on port 8888 on localhost and selected IP, forwarding to 5000 in the pod
  kubectl port-forward --address localhost,10.19.21.23 pod/mypod 8888:5000
  
  # Listen on a random port locally, forwarding to 5000 in the pod
  kubectl port-forward pod/mypod :5000
```

{{ header }} Options

```shell
      --address=[localhost]
            Addresses to listen on (comma separated). Only accepts IP addresses or localhost as a   
            value. When localhost is supplied, kubectl will try to bind on both 127.0.0.1 and ::1   
            and will fail if neither of these addresses are available to bind.
      --pod-running-timeout=1m0s
            The length of time (like 5s, 2m, or 3h, higher than zero) to wait until at least one    
            pod is running
```
