## Container registry authentication

You must log in to the container registry to work with the images. Use the [werf cr login](https://werf.io/documentation/v1.2/reference/cli/werf_cr_login.html) command as follows:

```shell
werf cr login <registry url>
```

For example:

```shell
# Log in with a username and password from the command line
werf cr login -u username -p password registry.example.com

# Log in with a token from the command line
werf cr login -p token registry.example.com

# Log in to an insecure registry (over HTTP)
werf cr login --insecure-registry registry.example.com
```

> Note: In supported CI/CD systems, the user gets authenticated to the integrated container registries as part of the [ci-env](https://werf.io/documentation/v1.2/reference/cli/werf_ci_env.html) command â€” you do not have to use the [werf cr login](https://werf.io/documentation/v1.2/reference/cli/werf_cr_login.html) command in this case.
