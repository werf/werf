## What is Git mapping?

***Git mapping*** defines a file or a directory in the Git repository that should be added to the image at the particular path. The repository may be a local one, hosted in the directory that contains the config, or a remote one. In the latter case, the configuration of the _git mapping_ includes a repository address and version (branch, tag, or commit hash).

werf adds files from the repository to the image either by fully transferring them via git archive or by applying patches between commits. Full transfer is used to add files for the first time. Subsequent builds apply patches to reflect changes in a Git repository. Refer to the [More details: git_archive...](#more-details-gitarchive-gitcache-gitlatestpatch) section to learn more about the algorithm behind fully transferring and applying patches.

The configuration of _git mappings_ supports file filtering. You can use a set of _git mappings_ to create virtually any file structure in the image. Also, you can specify the owner and the group for the files in the _git mapping_ configuration (so no need to run `chown`).

werf supports Git submodules. If it detects that the files specified in the _git mapping_ configuration are present in the submodules, it will act accordingly to change the files in the submodules correctly.

> All submodules in a project are bound to a specific commit. That way, all the collaborators get the same content. werf **does not initialize or update the submodules**. Instead, it merely uses these bound commits.

Below is an example of a _git mapping_ configuration. In it, source files are added from a local repository (`/src` is the source and `/app` is the destination directory), while remote phantomjs source files are imported and saved in `/src/phantomjs`:

```yaml
git:
- add: /src
  to: /app
- url: https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs
  add: /
  to: /src/phantomjs
```

## Syntax of a git mapping

The _git mapping_ configuration for a local repository has the following parameters:

- `add` — path to a directory or a file whose contents must be copied into the image. The path must be specified relative to the repository root and is absolute (i.e., starts with `/`). This parameter is optional; by default, the contents of the entire repository are transferred, that is, an empty `add` is equivalent to `add: /`;
- `to` — the path in the image to copy the contents specified with `add` to;
- `owner` — the name or uid of the owner of the files to be copied;
- `group` — the name or gid of the owner’s group;
- `excludePaths` — a set of masks to exclude files or directories during recursive copying. Paths in masks must be specified relative to add;
- `includePaths` — a set of masks to include files or directories during recursive copying. Paths in masks must be specified relative to add;
- `stageDependencies` — a set of masks to monitor for changes that trigger rebuilds of the user stages. This is reviewed in detail in the [Running assembly instructions]({{ "usage/build/stapel/instructions.html" | true_relative_url }}) reference.

The _git mapping_ configuration for a remote repository has some additional parameters:
- `url` — the address of the remote repository;
- `branch`, `tag`, `commit` — the name of a branch, tag, or a commit hash to use. If these parameters are omitted, the master branch will be used.

> By default, the use of the `branch` directive is not allowed by giterminism (read more about it [here]({{ "usage/project_configuration/giterminism.html" | true_relative_url }}))

## Using git mappings

### Copying directories

The `add` parameter defines a source path in the repository. Then all files in this directory are recursively retrieved and added to the image at the `to` path. If the parameter is not set, werf will use the default path ( `/` ). In other words, the entire repository will be copied. For example:

```yaml
git:
- add: /
  to: /app
```

The following basic _git mapping_ configuration adds all repository contents to the `/app` directory in the image.

<div class="tabs">
  <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="tabs__btn btn__example1 active" onclick="openTab(event, 'btn__example1', 'tab__example1', 'git-mapping-01-source')">Git repo structure</a>
  <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="tabs__btn btn__example1" onclick="openTab(event, 'btn__example1', 'tab__example1', 'git-mapping-01-dest')">Structure of a resulting image</a>
</div>
<div id="git-mapping-01-source" class="tabs__content tab__example1 active">
  <img src="{{ "images/build/git_mapping_01.png" | true_relative_url }}" alt="git repository files tree" />
</div>
<div id="git-mapping-01-dest" class="tabs__content tab__example1">
  <img src="{{ "images/build/git_mapping_02.png" | true_relative_url }}" alt="image files tree" />
</div>

You can specify multiple _git mappings_:

```yaml
git:
- add: /src
  to: /app/src
- add: /assets
  to: /static
```

<div class="tabs">
  <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="tabs__btn btn__example2 active" onclick="openTab(event, 'btn__example2', 'tab__example2', 'git-mapping-02-source')">Git repo structure</a>
  <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="tabs__btn btn__example2" onclick="openTab(event, 'btn__example2', 'tab__example2', 'git-mapping-02-dest')">Structure of a resulting image</a>
</div>
<div id="git-mapping-02-source" class="tabs__content tab__example2 active">
  <img src="{{ "images/build/git_mapping_03.png" | true_relative_url }}" alt="git repository files tree" />
</div>
<div id="git-mapping-02-dest" class="tabs__content tab__example2">
  <img src="{{ "images/build/git_mapping_04.png" | true_relative_url }}" alt="image files tree" />
</div>

Note, however, that the _git mapping_ parameter doesn't specify the directory to transfer (like `cp -r /src /app`). Instead, the `add` parameter specifies the contents of a directory to be recursively transferred from the repository. That is, to copy the contents of the `/assets` directory to the `/app/assets` directory, you have to specify the **assets** keyword twice in the configuration or use the `includePaths` [filter](#using-filters). For example:

```yaml
git:
- add: /assets
  to: /app/assets
```

or

```yaml
git:
- add: /
  to: /app
  includePaths: assets
```

### Changing the owner

The _git mapping_ configuration provides the `owner` and `group` parameters. These are the names or numerical IDs of the owner and group (userid, groupid) common to all files and directories transferred to the image.

```yaml
git:
- add: /src/index.php
  to: /app/index.php
  owner: www-data
```

![index.php owned by www-data user and group]({{ "images/build/git_mapping_05.png" | true_relative_url }})

If the `group` parameter is omitted, then the group is set to the primary group of the user.

If the `owner` or `group` value is a string, then the specified user or group must exist in the system by the moment the transfer of files is complete. They must be added in advance if necessary (e.g., at the beforeInstall stage), otherwise, the build will end with an error.

```yaml
git:
- add: /src/index.php
  to: /app/index.php
  owner: wwwdata
```



### Using filters

werf uses the `includePaths` and `excludePaths` parameters to process the file list. These parameters contain a set of paths or masks to include and exclude files and directories to/from the list of files to transfer to the image. The `excludePaths` filter works as follows: masks are applied to each file found in the `add` path. If there is at least one match, the file is ignored; if no matches are found, the file gets added to the image. `includePaths` works the opposite way: if there is at least one match, the file gets added to the image.

The _git mapping_ configuration can include both filters. In this case, the file will be added to the image if the path matches any of `includePaths` masks and does not match all `excludePaths` masks.

For example:

```yaml
git:
- add: /src
  to: /app
  includePaths:
  - '**/*.php'
  - '**/*.js'
  excludePaths:
  - '**/*-dev.*'
  - '**/*-test.*'
```

In the above example, `.php` and `.js` files from `/src` are added to the image, excluding files with the `-dev.` or `-test.` suffixes in the filename.

> The step involving the addition of a `**/*` template is here for convenience: the most common use case of a _git mapping_ with filters is to configure recursive copying for the directory. The addition of `**/*` allows you to specify the directory name only; thus, its entire contents would match the filter

Masks support the following wildcards:

- `*` — matches any file. This pattern includes `.` and excludes `/`;
- `**` — matches directories recursively or files expansively;
- `?` — matches exactly one character. It is equivalent to /.{1}/ in regexp;
- `[set]` — matches any character within the set. It behaves exactly like character sets in regexp, including the set negation ([^a-z]);
- `\` — escapes the next metacharacter.

Masks that start with `*` or `**` should be escaped with quotation marks in the `werf.yaml` file:
 - `"*.rb"` — with double quotation marks
- `'**/*'` — with single quotation marks

Filter examples:

```yaml
add: /src
to: /app
includePaths:
# match all php files residing directly in /src
- '*.php'

# match recursively all php files in /src
# (also matches *.php because '.' is included in **)
- '**/*.php'

# match all files in /src/module1 recursively
# an example of the implicit addition of **/*
- module1
```

You can use the `includePaths` filter to copy a single file without renaming it:
```yaml
git:
- add: /src
  to: /app
  includePaths: index.php
```

### Overlapping of target paths

Those who prefer to add multiple _git mappings_, have to remember that overlapping paths defined in `to` may result in an inability to add files to the image. For example:

```yaml
git:
- add: /src
  to: /app
- add: /assets
  to: /app/assets
```

When processing a config, werf calculates possible overlaps among all _git mappings_ related to `includePaths` and `excludePaths` filters. If an overlap is found, werf tries to resolve the conflict by adding `excludePaths` into the _git mapping_ implicitly. In all other cases, the build will end with an error. However, the implicit `excludePaths` filter may have undesirable side effects, so it is best to avoid conflicts caused by overlapping paths between the configured git mappings.

Here is an example of implicit `excludePaths`:

```yaml
git:
- add: /src
  to: /app
  excludePaths:  # werf add this filter to resolve a conflict
  - assets       # between paths /src/assets and /assets
- add: /assets
  to: /app/assets
```

## Working with remote repositories

werf can use remote repositories as file sources. For this, you have to specify the repository address via the `url` parameter in the _git mapping_ configuration. werf supports `https` and `git+ssh` protocols.

### https

The syntax for the `https` protocol is as follows:

{% raw %}
```yaml
git:
- url: https://[USERNAME[:PASSWORD]@]repo_host/repo_path[.git/]
```
{% endraw %}

You may have to enter your credentials to access the repository over `https`.

Here is an example of using GitLab CI variables for retrieving a login and password:

{% raw %}
```yaml
git:
- url: https://{{ env "CI_REGISTRY_USER" }}:{{ env "CI_JOB_TOKEN" }}@registry.gitlab.company.name/common/helper-utils.git
```
{% endraw %}

In the above example, we use the [env](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/os.html) method from the sprig library for accessing the environment variables.

### git, ssh

werf supports accessing the repository via the `git` protocol. This protocol is usually secured with SSH: this feature is used by GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, Gogs, Gitolite, etc. The typical repository address will look as follows:

```yaml
git:
- url: git@gitlab.company.name:project_group/project.git
```

A good understanding of how werf searches for access keys is required to use the remote repositories over SSH (read more below).

#### Working with SSH keys

The ssh-agent provides keys for SSH connections. It is a daemon operating via a file socket. The path to the socket is stored in the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable. werf mounts this file socket into all _assembly containers_ and sets the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable, i.e., connection to remote Git repositories is established using keys registered in the running ssh-agent.

werf applies the following algorithm for using the ssh-agent:

- If werf is started with the `--ssh-key` flag (there might be multiple flags):
  - A temporary ssh-agent starts and uses the defined keys; it is used for all Git operations with remote repositories.
  - The already running ssh-agent is ignored in this case.
- No `--ssh-key` flag(s) is specified and ssh-agent is running:
  - werf uses the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable; keys that are added to this agent are used for Git operations.
- No `--ssh-key` flag(s) is specified and ssh-agent is not running:
  - If the `~/.ssh/id_rsa` file exists, werf runs the temporary ssh-agent with the key from the `~/.ssh/id_rsa` file.
- If none of the previous options is applicable, the ssh-agent no SSH keys will be used for operations on external Git repositories. Building an image with the remote repositories defined in the _git mapping_ will fail.

## More details: gitArchive, gitCache, gitLatestPatch

Let us review the process of adding files to the final image in more detail. As it was stated earlier, the docker image contains multiple layers. To understand what layers werf create, let's examine building actions triggered by three sample commits: `1`, `2`, and `3`:

- Commit 1. All files are added to a single layer depending on the _git mappings_ configuration. This is done with using the git archive command. The resulting layer corresponds to the _gitArchive_ stage.
- Commit 2. Another layer is added. In it, files are modified by applying a patch. This layer corresponds to the _gitLatestPatch_ stage.
- Commit 3. Files have been added already, and werf applies patches in the _gitLatestPatch_ stage layer.

The build sequence for these commits may be represented as follows:

| | gitArchive | gitLatestPatch |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Commit No. 1 is made, build at 10:00 |  files as in commit No. 1 | - |
| Commit No. 2 is made, build at 10:05 |  files as in commit No. 1 | files as in commit No. 2 |
| Commit No. 3 is made, build at 10:15 |  files as in commit No. 1 | files as in commit No. 3 |

With time, the number of commits grows, and the size of the patch between commit No. 1 and the current one may grow quite large. This will increase the size of the last layer and the overall size of the stages even more. To prevent the uncontrolled growth of the latest layer, werf provides the additional intermediary stage called _gitCache_. When _gitLatestPatch_ diff becomes excessively large, much of its diff is merged with the _gitCache_ diff, thus reducing the _gitLatestPatch_ stage size.

### _git stages_ and rebasing

Each _git stage_ stores service labels containing SHA commits that this _stage_ was built up on.
werf will use them for creating patches when assembling the next _git stage_ (in a nutshell, it is a `git diff COMMIT_FROM_PREVIOUS_GIT_STAGE LATEST_COMMIT` for each described _git mapping_).
So, if some stage has a saved commit that is not in the Git repository (e.g., after rebasing), werf will rebuild that stage at the next build using the latest commit.

## Git worktree

For the Stapel builder to work properly, werf needs the full Git history of the project in order to work efficiently. So by default, werf fetches the history for the current Git project when needed. This means that werf can automatically convert the shallow-clone repository to a full clone and download an updated list of branches and tags from the origin during image cleanup.

The default behavior is defined using the following settings:

```yaml
gitWorktree:
  forceShallowClone: false
  allowUnshallow: true
  allowFetchOriginBranchesAndTags: true
```

For example, here is how you can disable automatic unshallow of the Git working directory:

```yaml
gitWorktree:
  forceShallowClone: true
  allowUnshallow: false
```
